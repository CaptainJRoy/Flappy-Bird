# Flappy-Bird
Flappy Bird in Java with OpenGL

<br>
So this is an approach i followed to make the famous android game "Flappy Bird". <br>
I had as refference a video tutorial provided by youtube user [TheChernoProject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=527bR2JHSR0). <br>
I've made minor modifications, as of today this is working 100%. <br>
<br>
I followed this tutorial because i wanted to learn how to integrate graphical stuff with "purely code programming". <br>
If you have any doubts don't hesitate to ask, as i'll try to reply to the things i know and learn with the things i don't. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hope you have a great evening. <br>
